Get user info from /etc/passwd and chown their home directory
Let's face it, sometimes when you give Jr. Admins too much access they tend to make rookie mistakes. Like chowning the /home directory recursively to the root user... In this example we will grab the username and home directory of each "real user" in the /etc/passwd and changing the ownership of the home directory to a more realistic owner.

$ IFS=$'\n'
$ for USERINFO in `grep "/bin/bash" /etc/passwd | grep ":/home"`
 > do
 > USERNAME=$(echo $USERINFO | cut -d: -f1)
 > HOMEDIR=$(echo $USERINFO | cut -d: -f6)
 > chown -R $USERNAME $HOMEDIR
 > done
