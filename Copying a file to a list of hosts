Copying a file to a list of hosts
I often find myself wanting to copy a file to a number of hosts. Rather than running scp manually over and over I usually tend to write an adhoc for loop that is similar to the following.

$ for HOST in ubuntu01 fedora02 centos03 rhel06
 > do
 > scp somefile $HOST:/var/tmp/
 > done
